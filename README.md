FAIL* - FAult Injection Leveraged
=======================================

FAIL* is a fault-injection (FI) framework that provides support for
detailed fault-injection campaigns. It provides carefully-chosen
abstractions simplifying both the implementation of different
simulator/hardware target backends and the reuse of experiment code,
while retaining the ability for deep target-state access for
specialized FI experiments.

The FI experiments are expressed with C++ and programmed against the
FAIL* API which provides full access to the internal state of the
system-under-test. Currently, several hardware/simulator based
backends are available:

- [Bochs](http://bochs.sourceforge.net): Bochs is an x86
  simulator. FAIL* can run and inject bare-metal system images. This
  backend is the most mature and well tested one for undertaking large
  fault-injection campaigns with several millions of injected faults.

- [Gem5](http://www.gem5.org): Gem5 is a simulator for the ARM
  platform, which is supported by FAIL. For Gem5, FAIL supports the
  simulation of the Panda Board, which contains an ARM A9 core.

- [OpenOCD](http://openocd.org/): The OpenOCD project provides a
  unified debugging interface for real embedded ARM platforms. FAIL
  uses this interface to inject faults onto a real hardware
  platform. Several techniques, like SmartHopping, were developed to
  make campaigns with real hardware faster and more feasible.

- Support for other platforms were developed, but are not as mature as
  the other backends: The Trace32 simulator backend for TriCore; An
  x86 backend using QEMU.

During the FI experiment, FAIL provides an interface for triggering
actions on certain instructions, instruction ranges, memory
reads/writes, interrupts, IO operations and timer events. As well the
state of the registers as the main memory of the system-under-test can
be manipulated.

Building FAIL*
--------------

**Note:** The Docker images are currently out of date; at the moment, FAIL*
needs to be built and installed manually.

Since FAIL* is a complex research project with many dependencies,
which are listed in `doc/how-to-build.txt`, we provide several
[Docker.io](http://www.docker.com) images that contain all
requirements to build and run a FI campaign with FAIL. After
installing and starting docker on your system, you have to type in the
root directory of the git archive:

    cd scripts/docker; make

As a result, you get three docker images:

- **fail-base**: The docker image contains all requirements to build
  FAIL*. This docker image is built on top of ubuntu 14.10 and
  provides access via SSH (User: fail; Password: fail).

- **fail-generic-tracing**: Upon the fail-base image, this images
  provides the tooling to generate golden-run traces of the
  system-under-test. These traces contain all instruction pointer and
  memory events of the golden run. The FAIL toolchain can record,
  show, and import those traces to an MySQL database.

- **fail-demo**: This image contains as well an generic FAIL
  experiment, a simple system-under-test, and scripts to run an first
  FI campaign within less than 20 minutes. This image has to be
  connected to a MySQL docker image.

Using FAIL*
-----------

After building the docker images, you can run the FAIL demonstration
image by typing:

    cd scripts/docker
    docker pull mysql
    make run-fail-db
    make run-fail-demo
    make ssh-fail-demo

The last command starts a SSH connection to the demonstration
system. Username, as well as password is 'fail'. In the default
configuration, no SSH port is exposed to your normal network
interface. After the connection, you should start in the
`~/fail-targets` directory, which contains a clone of
[https://github.com/danceos/fail-targets](https://github.com/danceos/fail-targets).

The demo system-under test is built and traced with:

    make
    make trace-main

The golden run is traced with:

    make import-main

The fault injection itself is separated into a server process and many
injection workers. Both can be started at once with:

    make server-main &
    make client-main

The results can be displayed on the console or with an browser-based
viewer. By default, port 5000 is exposed to the machine running the
docker instance.

    make result-main
    make resultbrowser
