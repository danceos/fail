Coding Style for Fail*
======================

You may violate/break any of the following rules if you have a good reason to
do so, e.g., if readability is notably enhanced.

For Python code, try to stick to <http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008>.
Especially use 4 spaces per indentation level, and don't mix tabs and spaces
for indentation.

The following style rules apply to C/C++/AspectC++ code:

 - Language (comments, SVN commit messages, "temporary" stuff): English
   (without exception)

 - Naming conventions:
    * Source files: .cc (Source), .hpp (Header), .ah (Aspect Header), MixedCase
    * Namespaces: lowercase
    * Classes, (global) functions: MixedCase, starting with uppercase letter
    * Public members: MixedCase, starting with lowercase letter
    * Private & protected members: starting with "m_"
    * Global Variables: starting with "g_"
    * Preprocessor macros: uppercase
      -  Include guard for MyFooBar.hpp: __MY_FOO_BAR_HPP__
    * Constant variables: uppercase
    * (no convention for local variables)
    * typedefs: lowercase, underscores (good_name_t)
    * abbreviations (even in identifiers): uppercase

 - Comments:
    * Doxygen comments:
       -  In detail for all public members (parameters, return value, side
          effects, ...)
       -  (At least) Briefly for private/protected members
       -  At the top of each (aspect) header file: @brief
       -  For each complex data type (and its elements)
    * Explain *nontrivial* program logic not only by describing the "what's
      happening here", but also the "why are we doing it this way".
    * Use "normal" C/C++ comments within functions (//, /**/).
    * No author names, creation dates, change logs etc. in source files.
      That's why we're using a VCS.

 - Formatting:
    * Indentation: 1 tab (tabstop at 4 spaces)
       -  may be relaxed / mixed with spaces for better readability of
          multi-line statements, e.g.:
      <TAB>cout << "The counter value is: "
      <TAB>     << value;
      <TAB>if (first_looong_condition &&
      <TAB>    second_looong_condition) {
      <TAB><TAB>...
    * Preprocessor directives start in column 1.
    * Max. line length: 100 characters.
    * "public"/"private"/"protected" has the same identation as its surrounding
      "class Foo" statement (we'd waste one indentation level for every class
      definition otherwise):
          class Foo {
          public:
          <TAB>void doSomething();
          };
      Similarly (and for the same reason) for namespaces and switch/case
      statements:
          switch (foo) {
          case 1:
          <TAB>...
          }
    * Compound statements (blocks): <Space>+'{' in the same line as its
      governing control structure (if, while, for, switch, try) or
      namespace/class definition:
          if (something) {
          <TAB>...
          }
    * Method/Function definitions are an exception to this ('{' in a new line):
      Definition:                   |  Declaration:
          void myFunction(int i)    |      void myFunction(int i);
          {                         |
          <TAB>...                  |
          }                         |
    * Control structure tokens ("if", "try", for, ...) are followed by a
      single space for better disambiguation from function definitions:
          if (...) {
          <TAB>...
          } else if (...) {
          <TAB>...
          } else {
          <TAB>...
          }
